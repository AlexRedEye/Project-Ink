# Resource System — Momentum

## Purpose
Momentum is a **light resource** that gates powerful actions
without adding heavy cooldown management.

## MVP Momentum Rules (Optional)
- Units generate Momentum by:
  - dealing damage
  - taking damage
  - guarding successfully
- Specials may:
  - consume Momentum
  - require minimum Momentum

---

## Design Intent
- Encourages proactive play
- Prevents Special spam
- Adds tension to decision-making

---

## Constraints
- No per-character unique resource in MVP
- Momentum caps at a small value (e.g. 5)
- Momentum resets between battles
