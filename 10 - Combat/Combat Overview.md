# Combat Overview

## Goal
Turn-based team combat focused on:
- Team composition (soft roles: DPS / Support / Tank-Support)
- RPS advantage/disadvantage
- Clear player choice: **Attack / Guard / Special**

## Key Links
- Loop: [[10 - Combat/Battle Loop & Phases]]
- Turn order: [[10 - Combat/Turn Order System]]
- RPS: [[10 - Combat/RPS Advantage System]]
- Math: [[10 - Combat/Damage & Mitigation]]
- Actions: [[10 - Combat/Actions System]]

## Design Promises
- Mistakes are **recoverable to an extent**
- Strategy > brute force
- Systems must work without art/UI (headless sim)
