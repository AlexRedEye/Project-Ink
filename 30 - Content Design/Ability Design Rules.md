# Ability Design Rules

## Purpose
Prevent ability creep and maintain clarity.

---

## MVP Ability Rules
- One Special per character
- Must reinforce role identity
- Must interact with at least one system:
  - RPS
  - Guard
  - Status
  - Momentum

---

## Ability Constraints
- No “does everything” abilities
- No hidden math
- No long descriptions

---

## Good Ability Test
> “Can I explain this ability in one sentence?”

If no → redesign.
