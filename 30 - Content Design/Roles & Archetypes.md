# Roles & Archetypes

## Design Philosophy
Roles are **soft guidance**, not class locks.

---

## Core Archetypes

### DPS
- High damage
- Low survivability
- Relies on RPS advantage

### Support (Heal / Buff / Debuff)
- Enables team longevity
- Manipulates tempo
- Low direct damage

### Tank-Support Hybrid
- Absorbs damage
- Applies buffs/debuffs
- Controls enemy focus

---

## Training Interaction
Training can:
- reinforce role strengths
- or push units into hybrid builds
