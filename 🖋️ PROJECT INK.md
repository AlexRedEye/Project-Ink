## **Game Design Document (Draft v2)

---

## 🎯 High Concept

**Project Ink** is a **turn-based, team-building RPG** featuring **stylized 2D doodle art**, strategic combat, and character collection through **offline, non-monetized gacha mechanics**.

Players assemble teams of expressive characters, develop them through training and gear, and engage in tactical battles built around **rock–paper–scissors advantage/disadvantage**, **soft role design**, and **synergy-driven progression**.

The game emphasizes **strategy, collection excitement, and long-term investment** without live-service pressure or monetization.

## ⚔️ Core Combat System

### Combat Structure

- **Turn-based**
    
- Team-based encounters
    
- **Menu-driven navigation** inspired by _Uma Musume Pretty Derby_
    
- Clear feedback and readable outcomes
    

### Player Actions

Each character can perform:

- **Basic Attack**
    
- **Guard**
    
- **Character-Specific Special Attack**
    

Special attacks are the defining feature of each character and the main reason players seek specific units.

---

## 🔺 Advantage / Disadvantage (RPS)

Combat uses a **rock–paper–scissors-style system** where:

- Certain types gain offensive or defensive advantages
    
- Others suffer disadvantages
    

This system:

- Encourages thoughtful team composition
    
- Rewards matchup awareness
    
- Reinforces strategic decision-making over raw stats
    

---

## 👥 Roles & Team Composition

Roles are **soft and flexible**, not locked classes.

### Core Role Archetypes

- **DPS**
    
- **Support (Healing / Buffing / Debuffing)**
    
- **Tank-Support Hybrid** (Tanking + Buffing / Debuffing)
    

Characters naturally lean toward a role, but players can:

- deepen that role
    
- or intentionally **train characters away from it**
    

This allows experimentation and personal expression in team building.

---

## 🎰 Character Collection (Offline Gacha)

Character acquisition uses **gacha-style RNG** strictly for **collection thrill and anticipation**.

### Core Principles

- **Completely free**
    
- No real-money purchases
    
- Earned via gameplay:
    
    - quests
        
    - challenges
        
    - bosses
        
- **Weekly acquisition cadence**
    

### Gacha Pacing

- Players must **actively earn gacha currency**
    
- Weekly limits prevent rapid exhaustion of the roster
    
- A well-engaged player can unlock **~5 characters per week**
    
- Progression is intentionally slowed to:
    
    - preserve excitement
        
    - avoid burnout
        
    - make characters feel special
        

The system is designed to be **rewarding, not tedious**.

---

## 🧰 Gear & Equipment System

Project Ink includes a **light but meaningful gear system** to enhance strategy.

### Gear Acquisition

- Gear is earned through:
    
    - bosses
        
    - dungeon-style combat encounters
        
- Gear has **rarity tiers**
    

### Targeted Farming Philosophy

- Each farming location drops **only two gear sets**
    
- This reduces frustration and RNG overload
    
- Players can intentionally farm toward specific builds
    

---

## ✨ Gear Enchantments

Gear can be enchanted with focused effects such as:

- Attack boosts
    
- Healing boosts
    
- Tanking/defense boosts
    
- HP increases
    

Enchantments allow:

- build specialization
    
- role reinforcement or deviation
    
- fine-tuning without overwhelming complexity
    

---

## 🔗 Synergy Systems

### Team Synergy

- Bonuses based on:
    
    - role combinations
        
    - complementary abilities
        
    - RPS coverage
        

### Gear Set Synergy

- Equipping matching gear sets unlocks additional bonuses
    
- Encourages planning and long-term goals
    

---

## 📈 Character Progression & Training

Characters progress through:

- **Character levels**
    
- **Training systems**
    

### Training Philosophy inspired by _Uma Musume Pretty Derby_

- Training is **more rewarding but more difficult**
    
- A strong training run can outperform raw gear investment
    
- Training and gear are **equally important**, but:
    
    - training rewards mastery and planning
        
    - gear provides consistency and reliability
        

This creates meaningful decisions in how players invest time.

## 📜 Story & Lore

Project Ink features a **rich story and world lore** designed to increase emotional investment.

- Characters are narratively grounded
    
- Lore contextualizes combat, factions, and progression
    
- Story enhances gameplay without overwhelming it
    

---

## 🎨 Visual Style & Presentation

- **2D doodle-style art**
    
- Stylized, expressive characters
    
- Clean, menu-based UI
    
- Emphasis on charm, readability, and personality
    

---

## ⚖️ Difficulty & Failure Philosophy

- Mistakes are **recoverable to an extent**
    
- Poor decisions have consequences, but rarely end a run immediately
    
- Skillful play allows recovery through:
    
    - positioning
        
    - guarding
        
    - smart ability usage
        

The goal is tension without frustration.

---

## 🔁 Replayability & Long-Term Engagement

Replayability comes from:

- controlled RNG character collection
    
- gear rarity and targeted farming
    
- training experimentation
    
- team and role synergy exploration
    
- story-driven attachment to characters
    

Grinding is optional; mastery is rewarded.

- **Default team size** (intentionally TBD)
    
- Difficulty modes / scaling
    
- Endgame or long-term challenge loop
